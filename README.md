Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a software engineer with a deep love for the intersection of quantitative finance, product development, and technology. I built Finominal from scratch, developing over 20 investment tools that have transformed how financial advisors and portfolio managers analyze portfolios. Iâ€™ve also expanded the platform into six global markets, driving growth across Canada, Australia, India, and Europe.

ðŸŽ¯ My Vision:
Iâ€™m passionate about making finance more transparent and data-driven, cutting through the noise that often clouds the industry. Whether itâ€™s refining our tools or exploring innovative ways to integrate AI, Iâ€™m committed to building solutions that help people make smarter financial decisions.

Fun Fact:
I love the challenge of building things from the ground up and figuring out how to scale themâ€”whether itâ€™s a platform, a feature, or a fresh idea.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about fintech, AI, or building something impactful. Iâ€™m always happy to connect!

I share my learnings in [tech](https://engineeringjournal.substack.com/publish/posts) and [finance](https://passiveinvesting.substack.com/publish/posts) on substack which helps me understand the concepts even better.
